# Puzzle-100-doors-
There are N doors in a row (letâ€™s say 100), all doors are initially closed. A person walks through all doors multiple times and toggle (if open then close, if close then open) them in the following way: In the first walk, the person toggles every door. In the second walk, the person toggles every second door, i.e., 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, ... In the third walk, the person toggles every third door, i.e. 3rd, 6th, 9th, ... In the 100th walk, the person toggles the 100th door. Which doors are open in the end? Display visually the doors state for each iteration.
